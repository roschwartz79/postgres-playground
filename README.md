# postgres playground
Learning and collecting information about Postgres!

## Setup
I started a local cluster of Postgres, and use that to interact with while running this app. The role 'rob' with password 'xxx' 
is used here. 

Each time this app is started, a test database `names` is created with 3 entries in it, as this is
a playground. 

I will be adding/changing this repo frequently with my learnings and cool stuff!
